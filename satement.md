**Problem statement:**
Correctly performs basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).

Automatically stores the input expression and the resulting output for every successful calculation.

Provides a simple, user-initiated command (e.g., history) to display the complete, chronological record of stored calculations for verification and review.

Gracefully manages invalid inputs and arithmetic exceptions (like division by zero) without storing failed attempts.

**Scope of the project:**

Core Functionality

History Management

History Retrieval

User Interface

Basic Error Handling(Like: Division by zero)

**Target users:**

Developers and Engineers for quick tasks.

Data Analysts and Researchers to verify intermediate values from larger datasets.

Students for solving simple equations while learning basic programming concepts.

Users Who Prefer the Command Line:

**High-level features:**

The primary function is the execution of fundamental, single-operator arithmetic operations across both integer and floating-point values.

A dedicated command allows the user to instantly retrieve and display this complete, chronological log of calculations for review or auditing purposes.
